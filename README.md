This file contains a comprehensive analysis of hospital readmissions and patient outcomes using two datasets:

1. Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset: This dataset provides readmissions data for patients with diabetes across 130 US hospitals.
2. MIMIC-III Clinical Database: This dataset offers ICU data for patients, including clinical information and outcomes.

Python File:

The accompanying Python file contains the necessary codes for:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Data integration and merging
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Predictive modeling (e.g., regression, classification)
- Model evaluation and validation

Analysis and Presentation:

The complete task performed includes:

1. Data integration and preprocessing
2. Univariate and multivariate analysis of readmissions data
3. Identification of key clinical factors influencing readmissions
4. Development of predictive models for patient outcomes
5. Evaluation and comparison of model performance
6. Presentation of findings and insights through visualizations and summaries

The analysis and presentation provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between clinical factors, readmissions, and patient outcomes, enabling healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions and improve patient care.
